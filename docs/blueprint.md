- Quick Access 3D Cards: Interactive cards for key platform sections (Admission, Jobs, News, etc.) with tilt and shadow animations on hover and staggered entry animations to guide the user.
- Live Updates News Ticker: A horizontally scrolling news ticker with glass tile-like cards, auto-scroll, and animated status chips (e.g., 'New' pulsing glow) to keep users informed about recent events.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of intellect and the future.
- Background color: Near-black (#121212) to enhance depth and contrast in a dark UI.
- Accent color: Electric Violet (#8F00FF) for highlights, button glows, and interactive elements, providing a strong, contrasting visual cue.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a modern, techy feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clean, readable text.
- Use clean, outlined icons with neon glow effects.
- Implement glassmorphism with background blur and subtle grain.
- Employ micro-interactions (ripple, pulse) and ease-in-out/spring animations for a premium, smooth UX. Disable heavy motion on low-end devices.
