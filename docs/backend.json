    "reasoning": "This design prioritizes security and scalability for managing news articles. It leverages Structural Segregation by placing all news articles in a single collection, `/news_articles`, ensuring a homogeneous security posture. Access is controlled via a dedicated `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection. Only users with a document in that collection are considered administrators. This structure avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies, making security rules simpler and more robust. Since the news articles data only requires admin access to update, Authorization Independence is not applicable."
